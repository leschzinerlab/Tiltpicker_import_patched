# Tiltpicker_import_patched

##Original code by Neil Voss: 
TiltPicker-2.0b13: http://emg.nysbc.org/redmine/projects/software/wiki/TiltPicker 

##Changes:
ApTiltPicker_import.py - A patched ApTiltPicker.py that allows users to import particle coordinates and align them using the angle and tilt axis calculated with Tilt Picker.

The command line options are identical, except now the user can specify --picks1 and --picks2, which will be files containing the center coordinates (X and Y) of particles for the untilted and tilted micrographs.
